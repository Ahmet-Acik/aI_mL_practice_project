# AI & ML Practice Project

This project is structured for practicing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with Python, following best practices.

## Structure

- `data/` — Data files and datasets
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `src/` — Source code (modules, pipelines, utilities)
- `tests/` — Unit and integration tests

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Place datasets in `data/`
- Add and run notebooks in `notebooks/`
- Add source code in `src/`
- Add tests in `tests/`

## Best Practices

- Use version control (git)
- Write modular, documented code
- Add tests for all modules
- Use notebooks for exploration, scripts for pipelines
- Keep dependencies updated
